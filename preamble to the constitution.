The preamble to the Constitution is an introduction to the highest law of the land, setting the stage and communicating the intentions of the framers. It was drafted in six weeks during the summer of 1787 and outlines five objectives for the Constitution:

"to form a more perfect Union"
"establish Justice"
"insure domestic Tranquility"
"provide for the common defense"
"promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity"
The preamble itself does not define government powers or individual rights, but rather declares the 
enactment of the Constitution by "We the People of the United States." This language emphasizes the 
idea of nationhood and the permanence of the Union under the Constitution. The stated purposes for 
adopting the Constitution can assist in understanding, interpreting, and applying the specific powers 
listed in the articles. The Constitution is a written document, contrasting with nations like Great 
Britain whose "constitution" is a looser collection of written and unwritten traditions. 
The boundaries of what may be said and done in the name of the Constitution are marked by the 
words, phrases, and structure of the document itself.
